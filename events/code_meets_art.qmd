[![We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the esteemed faculty members of the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at IIT Gandhinagar for their significant contributions that have positively impacted our lives. In recognition of their dedicated efforts, we have crafted a memorial gesture in the form of a cover image for the CSE Department. This cover image incorporates individual portraits of each respected professor, carefully arranged in a mosaic format. A Lal-Minar serves as the background, enriched with a subtle polygraphic touch, symbolizing unity and diversity within our academic community. Through this artistic expression, we seek to convey our gratitude and admiration for our professors' profound influence on our academic journey and personal development. We earnestly hope that our esteemed professors find this tribute vibrant with the depth of our gratitude and the artistic representation of their impact on our academic community.](code_meets_art/ThirdLowRes.png)](code_meets_art/ThirdHighRes.png)

[![This piece is an abstract mirrored art which was made using processing development environment. We have tried to imitate idle scribbling with human-like brushstrokes. Every iteration of the code generates unique artwork. By simply changing certain parameters we can change the essence of the artwork. In the github repository you will find 2 codes: In the first one the brushstrokes are guided by a particle controlled by a physics engine. This stays true to the Code Meets Art ethos of generating an art piece exclusively by code. However to encourage audience interaction we have also added another piece of code wherein the brushstrokes are guided by the mouse pointer.](code_meets_art/Honourable2LowRes.png)](code_meets_art/Honourable2HighRes.png)
