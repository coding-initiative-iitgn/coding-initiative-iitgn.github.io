In recognition of their dedicated efforts, we have crafted a memorial gesture in the form of a cover image for the CSE Department. This cover image incorporates individual portraits of each respected professor, carefully arranged in a mosaic format. A Lal-Minar serves as the background, enriched with a subtle polygraphic touch, symbolizing unity and diversity within our academic community. Through this artistic expression, we seek to convey our gratitude and admiration for our professors’ profound influence on our academic journey and personal development. We earnestly hope that our esteemed professors find this tribute vibrant with the depth of our gratitude and the artistic representation of their impact on our academic community.\n\n\nPrize: Wireless Mouse worth Rs 800 for each member (Total Rs 1600)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASCII image of Mona Lisa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Size up to 2 members\nCan use any programming language\nYou are not allowed to use machine learning based generations.

Is it technically proficient and well-crafted?\nInteractivity and Engagement: Does the code-driven artwork engage the audience or user in an interactive and immersive manner?\nInnovation and Novelty: Does the use of code push the boundaries of traditional artistic mediums or introduce new ways of experiencing art?\nAesthetics and Visual Impact: How visually appealing and impactful is the final output? Does the code contribute positively to the artistic aesthetics?"
