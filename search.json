    "text": "Structure:\n\nCoding Contest:\nCoding contests often occur on websites like Codeforces and CodeChef. These contests would be used to engage the students. We will consider only individual participation.\n\n\nProblem Solving Session:\nThe contests will be followed by a problem-solving session by GRASP. This will help enhance the students’ skills.\nThe winners (Top 2/3) of each contest will get a special T-shirt.\nSome of the Possible Contests: CodeChef Starters, and Div3/Div4 of Codeforces.\nCodeChef and Codeforces are one of the most popular platforms for competitive coding. They provide high-quality novel questions. As these platforms are very popular, the problem solutions are also readily available online.\nThe contests are necessary to upskill. However, these clash with the mess timings. Therefore, we will be serving food and refreshments to the students. This will make it feasible for the students to participate in these sessions.\nIn this event’s first edition, we aim to conduct four contests."

This cover image incorporates individual portraits of each respected professor, carefully arranged in a mosaic format.

This stays true to the Code Meets Art ethos of generating an art piece exclusively by code. However to encourage audience interaction we have also added another piece of code wherein the brushstrokes are guided by the mouse pointer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Size up to 2 members\nCan use any programming language\nYou are not allowed to use machine learning based generations.
